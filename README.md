## About MABEL
MABEL is an open source self balancing robot that is inspired by the famous [Boston Dynamics Handle robot](http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7xvqQeoA8c "Boston Dynamics Handle robot"). The robot is controlled via an Arduino that handles all of the PID calculations (based off of open source [YABR](http://http://www.brokking.net/yabr_main.html " YABR") firmware) based on the angle received from an MPU-6050 Accelerometer/Gyro, whilst the pi manages Bluetooth and servo control, running an inverse kinematics algorithm to translate the robot legs perfectly in two axes.

> The goal of MABEL is to create an affordable legged balancing robot platform like the the Boston Dynamics Handle robot that can built on a hobby scale using cheap Amazon parts and components.

By having a balancing platform with articulated legs MABEL will be able to actively balance in multiple Axes and vary leg length depending on the surroundings to increase terrain and off-road performance.

MABEL has built on the open source [YABR](http://http://www.brokking.net/yabr_main.html "YABR") project for the PID controller but with the addition of servos and a pi that helps interface them and control everything.
### Features and design 
Some of the stand-out features that make MABEL different from other balancing robots are:
- **Movable Legs** (**Enhanced mobility**, **terrain** and **stabilisation** capabilities)
- **Inverse Kinematics** for each leg, enabling accurate translation in (x, y) coordinates using the [IKSolve.py](https://github.com/raspibotics/MABEL/blob/master/Raspberry%20Pi%20Code/IKSolve2.py) class
- **Raspberry Pi** enabled (for **Bluetooth control**, **wireless connectivity** and **Computer Vision** capabilities)
- **Common/cheap build materials** (All of the materials can be purchased off of Amazon/Ebay for a low cost)
- **Stepper Motors** (Accurate positioning and precise control)

### Non 3D Printable
Here are the Non 3D printable materials to build MABEL that **must be either purchased or sourced**. **This includes all of the electronics, mechanical hardware and fixings.** It is **recommended to overbuy the nuts and bolts fixings, as the exact number can change between builds.** This [amazon list](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/1K7SOU8MRG2K7/ref=cm_wl_huc_view) contains a rough idea of what needs to be purchased.
